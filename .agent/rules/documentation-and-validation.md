After adding any feature, modify the DOCS.md file to document the new feature.

The documentation should always contain a full summary of what the app does.

For each functionality added to the DOCS.md file, there must also be a guide for the Browser Agent on how to test the function in the application, so the tests can be repeated.

Include several test scenarios where needed to make sure each functionality is validated by the agent.
