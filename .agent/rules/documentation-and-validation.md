After adding any feature, modify the GEMINI.md file with the new feature. Include screenshots from the Browser Agent if possible.

After adding any new feature, the documentation should contain a full summary of what the app does.

For each functionality described in the GEMINI.md file, there must also be a guide for the Browser Agent on how to test the function in the application, so the tests can be repeated.

Include several test scenarios where needed to make sure each functionality is validated.
