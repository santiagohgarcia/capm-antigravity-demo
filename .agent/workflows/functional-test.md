Run the application and use the DOCS.md as a guide to execute a full functional testing of the app using the Browser Agent.
After running the tests, generate a summary of the results in a file named BROWSER_AGENT_TEST_<datetime>.md . This file should be in the folder ".agent/tests" along with other tests.
The file should contain screenshots of the tests taken by the Browser Agent. Also provide a table summary with all the test scenarios performed and their results.
